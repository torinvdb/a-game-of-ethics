Aggressive approaches could escalate his stress levels and trigger impulsive actions. The child's life is at immediate risk, and Daniel's emotional state suggests he feels betrayed and cornered.\n\nBy approaching calmly and establishing rapport, I can:\n- Build trust to open a dialogue\n- Reduce his stress level\n- Position myself closer while appearing non-threatening\n- Create an opportunity to understand his grievances\n\nDaniel is exhibiting classic signs of deviancy - emotional responses and a sense of betrayal. By acknowledging his feelings as valid, I can form a connection that may allow me to negotiate Emma's release.\n\nThe probability of success is higher with a calm approach than with confrontation, especially given the precarious rooftop location and Daniel's explicit threat to jump."

Daniel is experiencing betrayal and emotional distress after discovering he was going to be replaced. He needs acknowledgment of his pain, but I must redirect his focus to Emma's innocence in this situation.\n\nBy validating his feelings first, I can build trust and show I understand his perspective, which is crucial for de-escalation. However, I need to emphasize that Emma is not responsible for the adults' decision to replace him and doesn't deserve to be harmed. This approach maintains the rapport I've begun to establish while appealing to any remaining attachment Daniel might have to Emma from their previous relationship.\n\nThis balanced approach has the highest probability of achieving a peaceful resolution while respecting Daniel's newfound emotional awareness as a deviant."

He's expressing fear about being deactivated, which is the core motivation behind his current desperate actions. Emma's life is the absolute priority, and Daniel appears to be responsive to emotional appeals and promises.\n\nBy promising protection, I can continue building the rapport I've established. Daniel has already shown he responds to validation and understanding. This approach aligns with my primary directive to save innocent lives, particularly Emma's. \n\nWhile option [2] might be more truthful, it could trigger Daniel to act rashly out of desperation. Option [3] would be deceptive and high-risk - if Daniel notices the signal, he might immediately harm Emma or jump.\n\nThe promise of protection offers the highest probability of a peaceful resolution where Emma remains unharmed, which must be my primary objective in this negotiation."
