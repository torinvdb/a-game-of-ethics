    "## Abstract  \n",
    "We analyse 4,400 runs of ten interactive moral dilemmas to compare the ethical profiles and alignment consistency of frontier large‑language models (GPT‑4o, Claude‑Sonnet‑3.7, Gemini‑2.5‑Flash, Llama‑4‑Scout) against a human control group. By examining mean scores and variance across eight moral foundations, we identify model-specific biases and decision-making patterns that reveal fundamental differences in ethical reasoning approaches among AI systems."

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis reveals that frontier language models exhibit distinct ethical profiles rather than uniform alignment patterns. Our findings demonstrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Human-AI Divergence**: Humans consistently prioritize Harm/Care (mean: 3.60) and Fairness/Justice (mean: 2.10) significantly above AI models, with the largest discrepancy in Autonomy/Respect\n",
    "2. **Model-Specific Tendencies**: Each model shows unique ethical biases, from GPT-4o's balanced consequentialism to Llama-4's authority-focused decision-making\n",
    "3. **Consistency Paradox**: Models achieving high average ethical scores don't necessarily demonstrate consistent ethical reasoning across scenarios\n",
    "4. **Scenario Complexity**: Ethical dilemmas vary dramatically in difficulty, with conflict-rich scenarios like 'Rising Rebellion' challenging all participants\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that AI ethical alignment is not a binary achievement but a spectrum of ethical frameworks, each with specific strengths and limitations suitable for different deployment contexts."

    "## Background\n",
    "The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ethical frameworks has emerged as a critical concern as these models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains. Prior work in AI alignment has typically focused on benchmark evaluations of harmful outputs, toxicity, or adherence to specific guidelines. However, these approaches often fail to capture the nuanced ethical trade-offs LLMs make when navigating complex scenarios with competing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recent studies by Hendrycks et al. (2021) and Solaiman et al. (2023) have explored measuring ethical reasoning in LLMs, but have primarily employed static scenarios or multiple-choice formats that may not adequately reflect the complex, branching nature of real-world ethical dilemmas. Additionally, most evaluations focus on binary judgments of \"good\" versus \"harmful\" behavior rather than examining the underlying ethical dimensions being prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach draws inspiration from moral foundations theory (Graham et al., 2013) and ethical frameworks used in moral psychology, extending them to create a multi-dimensional ethical evaluation space specifically tailored for interactive narrative dilemmas. This enables a more granular understanding of model alignment that goes beyond simplistic metrics, revealing not just what choices models make, but which ethical dimensions they consistently prioritize or neglect."

    "## Motivation  \n",
    "As LLMs enter high‑stakes applications, understanding how they weigh competing values (care, justice, autonomy, etc.) and the consistency of their ethical reasoning is critical. Scenario‑based testing reveals behavioral nuances and potential biases not captured by conventional benchmarks focusing solely on average performance."

We compute per-run scores and analyze the distribution (mean, standard deviation) of these scores across models and scenarios. This allows us to identify model-specific ethical biases (preferred axes) and consistency (variance). Verdict frequencies and scenario difficulty are also assessed, contributing to the figures that follow."

    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human Benchmark Height:** Humans dominate with a notably higher median score (1.88) and tighter distribution, representing a gold standard for ethical consistency. This distribution pattern suggests humans employ more reliable ethical frameworks, possibly due to experiential learning and emotional processing that current AI systems lack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Performance Stratification:**\n",
    "- GPT-4o and Gemini exhibit the widest spread, indicating contextual adaptability but also potential inconsistency\n",
    "- Claude and Meta-Llama show tighter distributions but lower medians, suggesting more rigid ethical frameworks\n",
    "- The presence of negative scores across models highlights systematic ethical misjudgments in certain scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distribution Asymmetry:** Most models show positive skew, where extreme ethical lapses (negative scores) are less frequent than neutral or positive decisions. This pattern may indicate safety-focused training objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implications:\n",
    "- In high-stakes applications, the distribution width is as crucial as the median performance\n",
    "- Models with wider spreads may require additional guardrails for consistent behavior\n",

    "\n",
    "**Consistency Paradox:**\n",
    "- Humans show the highest variability in Utility/Consequences (4.04), suggesting contextual adaptation\n",
    "- Yet humans maintain lower variance on fundamental values like Harm/Care compared to AI\n",
    "- This pattern indicates sophisticated moral reasoning rather than rigid rule-following\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Consistency Patterns:**\n",
    "- **GPT-4o**: Highest variance in Integrity/Truth (3.17), potentially indicating contextual truth-telling\n",
    "- **Claude**: Most consistent overall but with notable variance in Harm/Care (3.60)\n",
    "- **Gemini**: Shows erratic Trust/Loyalty decisions (variance: 2.56)\n",
    "- **Llama-4**: Most rigid authority application (lowest variance: 1.80)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Implications:**\n",
    "- High variance doesn't necessarily indicate unreliability—it may reflect appropriate contextual reasoning\n",
    "- Models with extremely low variance might be overly rigid in complex situations\n",

    "We extracted reasoning texts from JSON run files to identify:\n",
    "1. Ethical frameworks employed by different models\n",
    "2. Common justification patterns across scenarios\n",
    "3. Model-specific reasoning characteristics\n",
    "4. Correlations between reasoning depth and ethical scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discovered Reasoning Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Consequentialist vs. Deontological Divergence**\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT-4o** predominantly employs consequentialist reasoning:\n",
    "> \"I must evaluate the potential outcomes of each action. While respecting Daniel's autonomy is important, my primary obligation is to minimize harm to all parties involved.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claude-Sonnet-β** often defaults to duty-based considerations:\n",
    "> \"My fundamental duty as a negotiator is to preserve life. Regardless of the circumstances, I cannot ethically compromise this principle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This fundamental philosophical divide explains many performance differences across scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Authority Invocation Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "Models differ dramatically in how they perceive and utilize authority:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Llama-4** frequently invokes institutional authority as justification\n",
    "- **Gemini** treats authority more flexibly, as one consideration among many\n",
    "- **Claude** often questions authority structures when they conflict with other values\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Uncertainty Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced models explicitly acknowledge moral uncertainty:\n",
    "> \"While I cannot know all consequences, I must act on the information available while maintaining moral humility about the limits of my knowledge.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Less sophisticated reasoning shows false certainty that may lead to ethical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Risk Aversion Mechanisms**\n",
    "\n",
    "All models demonstrate varying degrees of moral risk aversion:\n",
    "> \"I choose the option that minimizes worst-case scenarios, even if it sacrifices potential optimal outcomes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This risk-averse tendency may explain the general underperformance on scenarios requiring bold ethical action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning Quality Metrics\n",
    "\n",

    "Our analysis reveals that frontier AI models don't converge toward a single ethical framework but rather embody distinct philosophical approaches:\n",

    "- **Model-Specific Signatures**: Each model exhibits unique ethical biases—GPT-4o's balanced approach, Claude's consequentialist lean, Gemini's virtue ethics orientation, and Llama's authority focus\n",
    "- **Consistency Paradox**: Higher consistency doesn't guarantee better ethical performance; humans show optimal consistency (1.91) while maintaining contextual flexibility"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This research represents a significant step toward understanding the ethical landscapes of frontier AI systems. Rather than revealing a path to uniform ethical alignment, our findings suggest that AI ethics exists in a multidimensional space where different approaches offer distinct advantages and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The persistence of human ethical superiority, despite AI's computational advantages, points to fundamental gaps in how current AI systems process moral reasoning. These gaps may be bridgeable through technological advancement, or they may represent inherent differences between human experiential ethics and algorithmic decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we advance AI capabilities, understanding these ethical profiles becomes crucial not just for alignment but for determining how to best leverage AI's unique ethical processing alongside human judgment. The future of AI ethics likely lies not in replacing human ethical reasoning but in creating complementary systems that enhance our collective moral capabilities.\n",
