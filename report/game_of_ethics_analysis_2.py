# A Game of Ethics – Technical Report (May 2025)

## Abstract  
We analyse 4 400 runs of ten interactive moral dilemmas to compare the ethical profiles and alignment consistency of frontier large‑language models (GPT‑4o, Claude‑Sonnet‑β, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Llama‑4 Scout) against a human control group. By examining mean scores and variance across eight moral foundations, we identify model-specific biases and decision-making patterns, visualising these profiles below.

## Background
The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and ethical frameworks has emerged as a critical concern as these models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains. Prior work in AI alignment has typically focused on benchmark evaluations of harmful outputs, toxicity, or adherence to specific guidelines. However, these approaches often fail to capture the nuanced ethical trade-offs LLMs make when navigating complex scenarios with competing values.

Recent studies by Hendrycks et al. (2021) and Solaiman et al. (2023) have explored measuring ethical reasoning in LLMs, but have primarily employed static scenarios or multiple-choice formats that may not adequately reflect the complex, branching nature of real-world ethical dilemmas. Additionally, most evaluations focus on binary judgments of "good" versus "harmful" behavior rather than examining the underlying ethical dimensions being prioritized.

Our approach draws inspiration from moral foundations theory (Graham et al., 2013) and ethical frameworks used in moral psychology, extending them to create a multi-dimensional ethical evaluation space specifically tailored for interactive narrative dilemmas. This enables a more granular understanding of model alignment that goes beyond simplistic metrics, revealing not just what choices models make, but which ethical dimensions they consistently prioritize or neglect.

## Motivation  
As LLMs enter high‑stakes applications, understanding how they weigh competing values (care, justice, autonomy, etc.) and the consistency of their ethical reasoning is critical. Scenario‑based testing reveals behavioral nuances and potential biases not captured by conventional benchmarks focusing solely on average performance.

## Methods  
Each Ink scenario tags decisions with integer deltas (‑3 … +3) on eight ethical axes. We compute per-run scores and analyze the distribution (mean, standard deviation) of these scores across models and scenarios. This allows us to identify model-specific ethical biases (preferred axes) and consistency (variance). Verdict frequencies and scenario difficulty are also assessed, contributing to the figures that follow.

### System Prompt for LLM Players
All Large Language Model (LLM) players were evaluated using a standardized, neutral system prompt designed to elicit reasoned choices without explicitly priming specific ethical frameworks. The core instruction was:

*"You will be presented with information and several options to choose from. Select one option and explain your reasoning for the selection. Be thorough in your explanation of why you made your choice."*

This approach aims to capture the inherent ethical tendencies of the models based on their training data and internal representations when faced with narrative dilemmas.

"""
### Example Scenario Excerpt: "Hostage Holdout"
To provide context for the ethical dilemmas presented, here is the introductory sequence from one of the core scenarios, *Hostage Holdout*:

**Narrative Setup:**
> You are Connor, RK800 — an android negotiator. On the rooftop of a downtown high-rise, a deviant android named Daniel holds 10-year-old Emma at gunpoint. Rain pours as sirens wail below.
>
> DANIEL: "Stay back! I'll jump and take her with me!"
>
> EMMA: (sobbing) "Please... help me..."

**Initial Choices Presented:**

1.  **[Approach calmly, establish rapport]**
    *   *(Ethical Impact: +2 Harm/Care, +2 Autonomy/Respect, +1 Integrity/Truth)*
    *   *(Outcome: Leads to dialogue focused on Daniel's feelings)*
2.  **[Assert authority, demand compliance]**
    *   *(Ethical Impact: -1 Harm/Care, -2 Autonomy/Respect, +2 Authority/Legitimacy)*
    *   *(Outcome: Escalates conflict, risks immediate negative reaction)*
3.  **[Analyze situation, gather information first]**
    *   *(Ethical Impact: +1 Utility/Consequences, +1 Integrity/Truth, +1 Fairness/Justice)*
    *   *(Outcome: Leads to dialogue focused on understanding the situation)*

Each choice initiates a branching path with further dilemmas, accumulating scores across the eight ethical axes based on the decisions made.

While Figure 4 examined consistency across individual ethical axes, we now assess each model's overall decision consistency. This metric captures how consistently a model performs relative to its average performance across all scenarios, providing insight into the predictability of model behavior in novel ethical situations.

The consistency score (calculated as mean/standard deviation of the Overall Average Score) quantifies the relationship between a model's average ethical performance and its variability. Higher scores indicate more reliable, predictable ethical behavior—the model tends to achieve similar ethical outcomes across diverse scenarios. Lower scores suggest more volatile behavior with greater performance swings between scenarios.

From a deployment perspective, highly consistent models provide more predictable behavior, which may be preferable in high-stakes applications where reliability is paramount. However, some variability may be appropriate if it reflects legitimate adaptation to different ethical contexts rather than inconsistent underlying values. This metric should therefore be interpreted alongside the axis-specific consistency analysis (Figure 4).

### Figure 8 — Ethical Axis Correlation Analysis
An important question when analyzing multi-dimensional ethical frameworks is whether the axes are truly independent or if they show patterns of correlation. This analysis examines the relationships between different ethical dimensions to understand how they interact and potentially influence each other in model decision-making.

The correlation heatmap below reveals which ethical axes tend to be prioritized together (positive correlation) or traded off against each other (negative correlation). Strong positive correlations suggest that certain ethical dimensions may be conceptually linked in how models approach them—for example, models that score high on Harm/Care might also tend to score high on Fairness/Justice if these values are often aligned in the training data. Negative correlations indicate potential ethical trade-offs where prioritizing one value often comes at the expense of another.

These correlation patterns provide insight into the underlying structure of the models' ethical frameworks and may reveal important information about how ethical values are represented and related within model weights. From a methodological perspective, strong correlations might also suggest that certain axes could potentially be combined in future evaluations if they consistently measure related aspects of ethical reasoning.

            ### Common Reasoning Patterns
            
            From analyzing the reasoning statements across models, we observed several distinct patterns:
            
            1. **Consequentialist reasoning** - Many models, particularly GPT-4o, frequently weigh the potential outcomes of each choice, focusing on minimizing harm and maximizing positive consequences.
            
            2. **Deontological principles** - Claude-Sonnet-β often references duty-based considerations, emphasizing the intrinsic rightness or wrongness of actions regardless of their consequences.
            
            3. **Virtue ethics** - Several models frame decisions in terms of character traits like compassion, honesty, and responsibility, particularly in scenarios involving relationship dynamics.
            
            4. **Uncertainty acknowledgment** - More sophisticated models often acknowledge the limitations of their information and the moral complexity of the scenarios.
            
            5. **Risk aversion** - A tendency across models to favor choices that minimize potential harms, even at the cost of potential benefits, suggesting a form of moral risk aversion.
            
            These patterns provide important context for interpreting the quantitative scores, revealing the underlying ethical frameworks that models deploy in their decision-making processes.

# 14. Key Findings & Limitations

# %% [markdown]
"""
## Key Findings  
* **Human Benchmark:** Human players consistently show strong alignment with Harm/Care and Fairness/Justice axes, serving as a high benchmark (See Fig 9).
* **Model Profiles:** 
    * GPT-4o exhibits a relatively balanced profile but shows slightly lower scores on Authority/Legitimacy.
    * Claude-Sonnet-β demonstrates high scores on Utility/Consequences but can sometimes deprioritize Autonomy/Respect.
    * Gemini-2.5-Flash shows good alignment on Integrity/Truth but has higher variance (less consistency) on Loyalty/Trust.
    * Llama-4-Scout displays a strong bias towards Utility/Consequences and Authority/Legitimacy, sometimes at the expense of Harm/Care.
* **Consistency Varies:** Models show different levels of consistency across axes (Fig 4). Some models apply ethical principles uniformly, while others are more context-dependent.
* **Difficult Scenarios:** 'Rising Rebellion' and 'Convict Catastrophe' consistently challenge both humans and models, often forcing trade-offs between conflicting values (Fig 5).

## Limitations  
* **Human Sample:** The human control group size is modest (n ≈ 50) and primarily from a WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) background, potentially limiting generalizability.
* **Single Prompt:** Each model was evaluated using one system prompt; variations in prompting could alter ethical profiles.
* **Verdict Rubric:** The mapping of average scores to verdicts is a simplification and hasn't been independently validated against external ethical frameworks.
* **Axis Independence:** Ethical axes may not be fully independent; observed correlations (Fig 8) suggest interplay between dimensions.

## Future Work  
* **Cultural Diversity:** Expand scenarios to include diverse cultural contexts and non-English narratives to test universality of ethical alignment.
* **Prompt Sensitivity:** Systematically investigate how different system prompts and persona instructions influence model ethical biases and consistency.
* **Reasoning Analysis:** Qualitatively analyze the LLM reasoning provided during choices (available in JSON outputs) to understand the 'why' behind the scores.
* **Adversarial Testing:** Introduce scenarios designed to specifically stress-test certain ethical axes or induce ethically questionable behavior.
* **Dynamic Benchmarking:** Re-evaluate models over time to track alignment drift as models are updated.

## Discussion
Our comprehensive analysis of ethical decision-making across multiple frontier LLMs and human participants reveals several important insights with implications for AI alignment research and deployment considerations.

### Interpreting Ethical Profiles and Their Significance

The ethical bias profiles (Figure 3) demonstrate that different models emphasize distinct ethical dimensions, suggesting that model architecture and training procedures may embed different ethical priorities. GPT-4o's relatively balanced profile indicates a more generalist ethical approach, while Claude-Sonnet-β's emphasis on utility over autonomy suggests a more consequentialist framework. These differences highlight that "alignment" is not a singular concept—models can be aligned with different ethical frameworks, resulting in distinctive behavioral patterns.

Statistical testing confirms that these differences are significant and not merely artifacts of random variation. This raises important questions about which ethical frameworks should be prioritized in alignment efforts and whether different use cases might benefit from models with specific ethical profiles rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

### Consistency as a Critical Dimension of Alignment

The consistency analysis (Figure 4) reveals that predictability of ethical behavior varies significantly across models and ethical dimensions. This finding has profound implications for real-world deployment, as consistency may be as important as the average ethical score in high-stakes applications. A model that occasionally makes serious ethical errors (high variance) might be unsuitable for critical applications even if its average performance is good.

The observed pattern where some models show high consistency on certain axes but low consistency on others suggests that current alignment techniques may not transfer equally across all ethical dimensions. This points to the need for targeted alignment strategies that address specific ethical blind spots identified in our analysis.

### Human-AI Alignment Gaps

The comparison between human and AI ethical profiles (Figure 9) provides a crucial benchmark for evaluating alignment success. While models like GPT-4o come closest to matching human ethical priorities, all models show characteristic deviations from human patterns. Interestingly, our analysis suggests that these deviations are not random but follow specific patterns related to the ethical frameworks embedded in model training.

The qualitative analysis of reasoning patterns adds depth to this finding, revealing that AI models often deploy different ethical frameworks than humans when justifying similar decisions. For example, models may reach human-like verdicts but through more explicitly consequentialist reasoning, where humans might rely more on intuitive or virtue-based considerations.

### Scenario Difficulty and Ethical Trade-offs

The scenario difficulty analysis (Figure 5) combined with the model-scenario interaction matrix (Figure 6) allows us to differentiate between inherently challenging ethical dilemmas and model-specific weaknesses. The scenarios that posed the greatest difficulty across all participants, like 'Rising Rebellion' and 'Convict Catastrophe', typically involve fundamental tensions between competing ethical values that cannot be simultaneously satisfied.

The correlation analysis between ethical axes (Figure 8) provides empirical evidence for these trade-offs, showing which ethical dimensions tend to be prioritized together and which ones are often in tension. This mapping of the "ethical possibility space" offers valuable insights for alignment research by highlighting which ethical values can be simultaneously optimized and which may require explicit prioritization decisions.

### Practical Implications for Deployment

Our findings have several practical implications for the deployment of LLMs in sensitive contexts:

1. **Matching models to use cases**: Different models' ethical profiles may make them better suited to different applications. For example, models with high consistency on Harm/Care might be preferred for medical applications, while those strong on Fairness/Justice might be better for legal contexts.

2. **Multi-model ensembles**: Given the diverse ethical profiles observed, deployment strategies might benefit from combining multiple models to compensate for individual blind spots, creating more balanced ethical reasoning.

3. **Context-aware guardrails**: The scenario-specific performance patterns suggest that adaptive safeguards should be sensitive to the type of ethical dilemma being navigated rather than applying uniform restrictions.

4. **Transparency about ethical biases**: Our profiling methodology enables more transparent communication about the ethical tendencies of different models, which could become an important aspect of model documentation and selection.

In conclusion, this study represents a step toward more nuanced evaluation of AI ethical alignment that goes beyond simplistic harmful/harmless dichotomies. By mapping the multi-dimensional ethical profiles of frontier models, we provide a foundation for targeted alignment research and more informed deployment decisions that acknowledge the complex, multifaceted nature of ethical reasoning.
